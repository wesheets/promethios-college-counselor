# Promethios College Counselor - Remaining Blockers

## Overview
This document outlines the remaining blockers and considerations that need to be addressed before deploying the Promethios College Counselor to the Render environment.

## Schema File Dependencies
During implementation and testing, we encountered several missing schema files that are required by the GovernanceCore component:

1. **Emotion Telemetry Schema** (`mgc_emotion_telemetry.schema.json`)
   - Status: ✅ Resolved - Created schema file with appropriate structure
   - Impact: Required for emotional state analysis in the counseling system
   - Resolution: Created schema file based on expected structure

2. **Loop Justification Log Schema** (`loop_justification_log.schema.v1.json`)
   - Status: ✅ Resolved - Created schema file with appropriate structure
   - Impact: Required for override justification logging
   - Resolution: Created schema file based on expected structure

3. **Operator Override Schema** (`operator_override.schema.v1.json`)
   - Status: ✅ Resolved - Created schema file with appropriate structure
   - Impact: Required for the override system functionality
   - Resolution: Created schema file based on expected structure

## API Dependencies
The following API dependencies need to be configured in the Render environment:

1. **College Scorecard API Key**
   - Status: ⚠️ Pending - Needs to be configured in Render environment
   - Impact: Required for real college data integration
   - Resolution: API key needs to be added as an environment variable in Render

2. **OpenAI API Key**
   - Status: ⚠️ Pending - Needs to be configured in Render environment
   - Impact: Required for conversational AI and emotional state analysis
   - Resolution: API key needs to be added as an environment variable in Render

## Deployment Considerations

1. **Database Configuration**
   - Status: ⚠️ Pending - In-memory storage currently used
   - Impact: Data persistence between sessions
   - Resolution: For a production environment, consider adding a database service or persistent storage solution

2. **Authentication System**
   - Status: ⚠️ Pending - Simplified authentication implemented
   - Impact: User account management and security
   - Resolution: Implement proper authentication system before production use

3. **Error Handling and Logging**
   - Status: ✅ Implemented - Basic error handling and logging in place
   - Impact: System monitoring and debugging
   - Resolution: Consider enhancing logging for production environment

4. **Cross-Service Communication**
   - Status: ✅ Implemented - API URL configured in render.yaml
   - Impact: Web frontend to API backend communication
   - Resolution: Ensure proper CORS configuration in production

## Testing Requirements

1. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Status: ⚠️ Pending - Comprehensive end-to-end testing needed
   - Impact: System reliability and user experience
   - Resolution: Conduct thorough testing after deployment to Render

2. **Load Testing**
   - Status: ⚠️ Pending - Load testing not yet performed
   - Impact: System performance under load
   - Resolution: Consider implementing load testing before full production release

## Next Steps

1. Configure API keys in Render environment
2. Deploy to Render using the provided render.yaml configuration
3. Verify cross-service communication works correctly
4. Conduct end-to-end testing in the deployed environment
5. Address any deployment-specific issues that arise

## Conclusion
While all critical implementation blockers have been resolved, the items listed above need to be addressed during the Render deployment phase. The system is ready for initial deployment to Render, but will require configuration of API keys and thorough testing before being ready for production use.
